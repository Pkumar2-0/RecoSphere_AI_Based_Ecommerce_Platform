# RecoSphere_AI_Based_Ecommerce_Platform
This project is a multi-agent AI system designed to deliver hyper-personalized product recommendations for e-commerce platforms. Powered by LLaMA models running locally via Ollama, the system leverages intelligent agents (Customer, Product, and Recommender) communicating through an event-driven architecture with SQLite as long-term memory.
